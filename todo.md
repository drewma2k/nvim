# TODO
- consider [https://github.com/ray-x/go.nvim]
- consider nvim-surround / mini.surround
- fix lazy loading
- consolidate key mappings
- do I really need Neorg?
- stable install from scratch (yaml cli for nvim-java, neorg ts parser...)
- keybind logical groups

- [x] convert to lazyvim plugin management
- [x] gr is slow because grr exists
