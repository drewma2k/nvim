# TODO
- consider [https://github.com/ray-x/go.nvim]
- consider nvim-surround / mini.surround
- do I really need Neorg?
- stable install from scratch (yaml cli for nvim-java, neorg ts parser...)
- keybind logical groups
- make debugpy work without having to install it into the virtual env of the
  code
- make pylsp work without activating project venv shell
- use noice to remove escape characters in lsp hover?
- try vGit plugin
- better python lsp configuration, a la lazyvim
- set messagesopt? use noise to hide hit enter prompts?
  - messageopt still flashes cmd output even with wait:0

- consider oil.nvim
